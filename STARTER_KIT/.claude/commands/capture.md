# Quick Capture

Something useful just happened. Let's save it in 30 seconds.

## What to Capture

Based on our conversation, I'll help you save:
- A solution that worked well
- A pattern worth reusing
- A gotcha to avoid

## Format

I'll create an entry in `.claude/sessions/captures.md`:

```markdown
## [DATE] - [ONE-LINE TITLE]

**Type**: [solution/pattern/gotcha]
**Context**: [1 sentence - when this applies]
**The insight**: [2-3 sentences max]
```

## Just Tell Me

What was the useful thing? I'll format and save it.
