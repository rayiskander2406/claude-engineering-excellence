# Team Patterns

Let me show you what the team has learned.

## Sources

I'll check:
1. `.claude/sessions/captures.md` - Recent insights
2. `.claude/patterns/` - Established patterns
3. Memory (if MCP server installed) - Cross-session knowledge

## What I'll Show

- Solutions that have worked multiple times
- Gotchas the team has discovered
- Patterns worth following

## Filter (optional)

If you want patterns about a specific topic, tell me:

$ARGUMENTS

Otherwise, I'll show recent and relevant patterns.
