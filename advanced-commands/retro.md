## Facilitation Guidelines

### Prime Directive
"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

### Best Practices
1. **Timebox**: Keep to scheduled time
2. **Equal voice**: Everyone participates
3. **Blameless**: Focus on systems, not people
4. **Action-oriented**: Generate specific actions
5. **Follow up**: Review previous actions

## Output Format

Generate:
1. **Retrospective document** with all sections
2. **Action items** with owners (to be assigned)
3. **Key themes** identified from discussion
4. **Metrics summary** if data available
5. **Suggested experiments** for next sprint
