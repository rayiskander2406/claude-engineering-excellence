# Claude Code in 5 Minutes

---

## 1. Install (60 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth
```

---

## 2. Your First Magic Moment

In any project directory:

```bash
claude "What does this codebase do?"
```

That's it. You're using Claude Code.

---

## 3. The ONE Habit

```bash
# Before every commit:
claude "/code-review"
```

This catches bugs, security issues, and mistakes before they reach your team.

**That's the only habit you need.** Everything else is optional.

## 4. Five Commands Worth Knowing

| Command | Example | When |
|---------|---------|------|
| `/code-review` | `/code-review` | Before every commit |
| `/explain` | `/explain src/app.ts` | When confused |
| `/help` | `/help` | Show all commands |
| `/capture` | `/capture` | Save an insight |

## 5. Three Rules

1. **You own what you commit** — Review suggestions before committing
2. **No secrets** — No API keys, passwords, or customer data
3. **Iteration is normal** — Conversations, not one-shot magic

---

## 6. Team Setup (Optional)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edutone/claude-engineering-excellence/main/STARTER_KIT/setup.sh | bash
```

This adds: project rules, stack patterns, pre-commit hooks, and the flywheel.

## That's It

You now know everything essential.

**Go build something.**
